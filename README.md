# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project to predict housing prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, and location. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building using Python.


## 📌 Project Motivation

House pricing is a classic regression problem and is often used as a benchmark to test machine learning skills. In the real estate market, having a tool that can estimate a property’s value helps buyers, sellers, and agents make better decisions.

The goal is to predict the **price of a house** based on features from a dataset and evaluate how well the model performs.
